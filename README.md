- 👋 Hi, I’m @freeky-interpreter
- 👀 I’m interested in building short personal projects so that I can teach myself and better understand coding...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything that catches my interest, mostly Javascript, HTML, CSS. Would love to get into C and Java soon (hopefully), maybe that one programming language for embedded systems too...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mylsef and with others, small projects, big projects, who knows really where this will take me...
- 📫 How to reach me: you shouldn't unless you wanna chat about interesting things @vincemed941@icloud.com ...
